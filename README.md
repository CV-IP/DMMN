# An End-To-End Tracker

This is an end-to-end network which combines detector and matcher into one single network. Our target is to design an **End-to-End network** for detection and tracking.

## Protocol
- bbox: the format is *(left, top, right, bottom)*
- $N_{tr}$: the track number.
- $N_{ba}$: the batch number.
- $N_{ti}$: the selected frame number
- $N_{pr}$: the number of prior boxes
- $W, H$: the input network image size (W, H).
- $W_{re}, H_{re}$: the real input image size.
- $F_t$: the $t^{th}$ frame
- $N_{fn}$: the input frame number
- $f(\cdot)$ is the operation to convert parameter to bboxes

## Network

The framework of our net is as following:
